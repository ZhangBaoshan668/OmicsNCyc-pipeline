# OmicsNCyc：An integrated pipeline for fast analysis of nitrogen cycle functional genes with a curated database
Version：v1.0.0

Update：2026/02/26

## Background
To accurately analyze microbially driven nitrogen cycling, current databases and bioinformatics tools face critical limitations, as existing nitrogen-cycle databases (e.g., NCycDB) suffer from a lack of standardized analytical thresholds, leading to high false-positive rates, while also containing ambiguous taxonomic classifications and applying inappropriate uniform clustering cutoffs to functionally diverse genes such as amoA. Furthermore, although metagenomics overcomes the primer bias inherent in amplicon sequencing, available analysis pipelines remain fragmented, with current tools either designed for specific tasks or, like web-based platforms, lacking the flexibility required for large-scale or customized analyses. Therefore, a comprehensive solution is urgently needed, necessitating the development of a rigorously curated database with gene-specific thresholds for similarity and taxonomy, coupled with an integrated, user-friendly cloud platform and open-source pipeline to enable precise, high-throughput profiling of nitrogen-cycling communities.Therefore, we developed the OmicsNCyc pipeline.
